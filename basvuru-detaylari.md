## PART 1 - YOUR IDEA

Please use the following form to share your idea with us. Remember, our goal is to introduce the next generation of coders to the FOSS community and encourage them to participate for years to come. We don’t have a particular solution in mind, so anything goes! Be creative as you want to be! 

### What is the working name of your project?

We realize the project name might change but what are you calling it now?

> The Open University Project

### Tell us in 200 words or less about your idea.

Use this section to grab the judges’ attention so they want to learn more about your entry! Feel free to include key features, unique elements, how it will meet challenge goals, etc.

> A communication network that assigns beginner coders to volunteer developers and aims to educate them in the open-source community and help them contribute to FOSS projects before they are ready. When they are ready, they are declared successful and given a certificate. The coders' later success will also be the educators' success.

## PART 2 - PROJECT DETAILS

One of the Challenge's primary goals is to improve the coding skills of beginner coders by introducing them to the FOSS community and encouraging FOSS community participation for years to come. We are interested in learning about how your entry meets this goal. Please help us gain a better understanding of your entry by addressing the following questions.

**Please remember to save your work, as you go along to avoid any accidental loss of content.**

### How does your entry introduce the FOSS community to beginning coders?

> The certification process differs with the level of knowledge that the coder possesses. Beginner coders, for instance, are taught the basics and the conventions that they should follow. When they complete their education, they are given The Beginner Certificate. This certificate means not only that they can code, but also that they are capable of following the conventions when they contribute to a project.

> Also to help them stay in the community, the projects supporting The Open University Project will tag issues appropriately to help beginners identify issues that they can resolve.

### As part of this Challenge we seek ideas that engage diverse populations that are often under-represented in the coding community. Will your submission engage members of this audience? If so, please explain.

Helpful hint: we recommend saving your work every few questions to avoid any accidental loss of content. 

> The educators on the platform will be volunteer developers, and as long as The Open University Project can maintain the developers from a variety of communities, we hope that people who follow and want to be like them will be on the platform and will want to do more. 

> In this sense, it could be said that the project will need the help of the open-source contributors and that The Open University Project should reward those who help and who are on it to learn which is done by certifying and adding them to the hall of fame. 

### Introducing coders to the FOSS community is important, but engaging and retaining them within the community is also crucial. Please explain how your project will engage and retain users.

> Similar to what GPL version 2 and 3 licenses dictate, the education and the certification are done free of charge. But what we want from those who are helped is to pick someone and educate if or when they can. 

> Because the type of education is different across different technologies, the given certificates will reflect this with names or different shades of colors (TBD).

### How will your project’s impact will be measured?

> If the open-source community, in general, adopts what The Open University Project does to help coders/developers; the certification program succeeds in a way that it is used by companies to hire developers to work on their projects; and people suggests their peers, friends or students join the program to educate or to get educated, this is what we will call success and thus the scale of impact that we made.

### What did we miss? Is there anything you want to add about your submission? 

Include any additional details about your project you think are relevant.

### Do you have any files to include with your proposal?

Supplemental materials are encouraged but not required. 

_Prepare your files and upload them when you are filling the actual survey._

## PART 3 - YOU/YOUR TEAM

> I have been in the open-source community for nearly 4 years. I didn't understand most of the things when I first started, but my open-source journey began when someone mentioned me about FOSS in around 2012 and told me that we can change the code and that it is an easy process. In around 2015, I open-sourced my app TrebleShot and started to work on open-source development models.
